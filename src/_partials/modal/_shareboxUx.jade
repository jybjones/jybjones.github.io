      h4.text-align-center Sh@rebox is an easy and safe way to lend, borrow, or trade items with local residents and friends in your area. Through a set of localized smart pods, modular storage spaces are filled with __insert awesome stuff here__. Our online platform manages the inventory and keeps the process transparent and efficient, so sharing can be second nature.  Got a slow cooker you used once for a party thatâ€™s now taking up space? Add it to Sh@rebox and allow your neighbors to use it too! &nbsp;
      h3.text-align-center Future versions will have other features such as user reviews and more locations.
